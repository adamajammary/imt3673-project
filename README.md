IMT3673 Project - App Ball Game (Android, Java)

## App ball game - Game(3D/2D) (lab 3 expansion)
* Code: lab3-expansion
* Category: game

## Main idea

Create a game using lab 3's ball (using physics to move the ball with acceleration and collision).

Either OpenGL or native Android graphics libraries can be used.

* https://developer.android.com/training/graphics/opengl/environment.html

Requirements:
* There should be an objective within the game (if not it wouldn't be a game really, would it?) and something to interact with (maybe: levers, pressure plates, ramps, holes, walls etc).
* There should be a menu the app starts up on, where the user can select:
  * Play
  * Options
  * Exit
  * Possibly others?
* There should be a User Preferences screen:
  * The progress of a user should be able to be private/hidden.
  * Blocking of users/friends.
* The game should have Google Play integration.
* Scoreboard (local and public) and be able to, if they want to, save a score to it.
* Be able to add friends (via Google play) and see their progress with the game (which levels they are on/have completed, highscores) (IF Available).

## Optional:
* Local Multiplayer: Should display devices that's close and once connected can play together (possibly BlueTooth or LAN?).
* Global multiplayer: A user should be able to invite their friends to play with them (WiFi).
* Security on multiplayer: Could anyone tamper with the packets (overwrite data, events that happen and more)? Hijack a game session to join private parties/games they shouldn't have access too? Other vulnerabilities?
